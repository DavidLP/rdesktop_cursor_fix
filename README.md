rdesktop_cursor_fix
===================

A simple script that fixes the ugly rdesktop cursors when using Windows 7. The original Microsoft Windows Aero (T) cursors are needed. They are not provided here but can be taken from a Windows 7 installation or easily found on the internet. To find out how to use the fix just run install_rdesktop_fix from the terminal.
To install the cursors you have to install icoutils and create the destination folder where they are installed!
